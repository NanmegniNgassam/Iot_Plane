# Iot_Plane
**C++ Project :** Iot_Plane console application
<br/>

![Our project is just one module of the IOT Plane concept](https://www.einfochips.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Swim2.jpg)

### **Purposes :**
* stores relevant data from a plane during a fly;
* displays data stored from a past fly.
<br/>

### Technical tools used : 
*git(obviously)*, *Makefiles(cmake)*, *coding Standard* , *UML* 
<br/>

### Description of the project :
  The project will consist in an Iot console application used to save relevant data *(temperature, Humidity, pression and light)* from a plane (*sensors*) during a fly. According to the staff's board(pilots, hostess, stewards...), the application will have some particular behaviors. After the start of recording, the data will be stored in the *server* and/or log simultaneously to the console. All that will be done at one pace told by the *Scheduler*.

  *Others Information :*
  * When we are not on a fly, we can have access to past recordings;
  * Before a fly, the polit must give a name to the fly;
  * At the end of the plan, he can rather or not give an average to the fly

**Note : Others details will be given through the following UML Diagrams**
